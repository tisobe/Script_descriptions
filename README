MTA Group Managed Software/Script List
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directory contains a perl cgi script which reads and creates a page
listing a MTA managed software/scripts list.

To see the page, open the following link on the browser:

    https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/mta_days/mta_script_list/mta_script_list.cgi

How to create an entry to the list
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

0  Please login as "mta" so that anyone from mta can edit the file you created.

1. Go to your directory (Scott, Brad, Takashi). If you are new and don't 
   have a directory set up, please contact tisobe@cfa.harvard.edu. 

2. Copy a template (e.g. sw_template.html) to an appropriately named file.
   Please keep your prefix (sw, bs, ti) for the case that we need to reorganized the 
   structure of the directories in future. 

3. In the file, fill the name of the task of the script/software between
   <title> tags. E.g., "<title>ACIS CTI</title>".

4. In the "Note" section, put the current problems/concern. This will display
   at the top of the main page. If there is nothing to mention, Keep "None".

5. Although the template shows general suggestions, you can modify them 
   as you needed, except style sheet and the format of <title> tags and "Note" section.

6. If you like to create the separate category like "MTA Related",
   created a directory in your directory. The name convention is, for example,
   "MTA_Related" for the above case. The script uses the directory name
   as the category name without "_".

As for an example, please see:

    /data/mta_www/mta_script_list/Takashi/MTA_Related/ti_aics_cti.html
